# PasswordMaker
Short python script that generates random passwords for you to use
## Content
I made this script using python and tkinter to design the UI, I wanted to try making a project that at the time was harder than what I was used to building,
I also made this much earlier than the commit date. I also wanted to make something that could be useful for me, and maybe other. This could have
been made without a UI and just ran in the terminal, but I wanted to try learning and using tkinter.
## Instructions
To run this go to it's file path in your terminal, and run 'python3 goodpassgen.py' this will bring up the window that runs the PasswordMaker, where you
press the button for generating a password and recieve your password. This generates passwords as many times as you would like.
